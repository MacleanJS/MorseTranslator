## Requirements / Purpose

###   Purpose of project:
- Create a functional 2-way translator for morse code and english.
- To gain extensive experience in testing through Jest and Babel.

---

## Build Steps

1. Download/clone project files.
2. Open the index.html file with live server.

## Design Goals / Approach

###   Design goals:
- For this project, my front-end design was initially created on Figma and implemented using SCSS. 
- I aimed for a simplistic and modern look.
- The site is responsive to different screen sizes.

---

## Features
- For the logic of the translation functions, objects were created to specify what characters were available in morse & english. Regex was used to test values against this library object. 

---

## Known issues

- One of the morse code characters is a bit iffy, needs more clarification in the regex. 

---

## Future Goals

-   Fix the above issue.
