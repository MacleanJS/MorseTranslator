# Welcome to my morse code to english translator app!
- This application's frontend was programmed using HTML and SASS, with the backend (translating functions) written in Javascript.
- For the logic of the translation functions, objects were created to specify what characters were available in morse & english. Regex was used to test values against this library object. 
- One of the main features of this MVP was to utilise Jest and Babel  to test a range of cases.
